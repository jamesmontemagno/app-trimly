        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p className="legal-meta">Last updated: December 18, 2025</p>

        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of TrimTally, including the mobile applications and this
          website (collectively, the "Service"), operated by Refractored LLC ("we", "us"). By downloading, installing, or
          using TrimTally you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>License and Use</h2>
        <p>
          We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use TrimTally for your personal
          weight-tracking needs on Apple-branded devices you own or control. You may not modify, reverse engineer, copy, or
          redistribute TrimTally except as permitted by Apple App Store terms and applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use TrimTally.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for safeguarding your device, Apple ID credentials, and any data you enter.</li>
          <li>You agree not to use TrimTally for unlawful, harmful, or abusive activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data and Sync</h2>
        <p>
          TrimTally stores your entries locally on your device by default. Optional iCloud sync keeps information in your
          personal Apple account; Apple controls the availability, encryption, and retention of that data. We do not access
          or manage your iCloud content. If you connect to Apple Health, all Health data flows through the HealthKit
          framework under Apple&apos;s policies and your explicit permissions.
        </p>

        <h2>Updates and Availability</h2>
        <p>
          We may provide updates that add, change, or remove features. Continued use after an update means you accept the
          changes. We may suspend or discontinue the Service at any time, and we have no obligation to maintain specific
          features.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          TrimTally is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. You rely on the Service at your own risk. We make
          no guarantees about accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, or availability. TrimTally is not a substitute for
          medical advice; consult a qualified professional for health-related decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Refractored LLC is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or
          consequential damages arising from your use of TrimTally. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the
          amount you paid (if any) for the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may revise these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of
          this page. Continued use of TrimTally after changes become effective means you accept the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, United States, without regard to conflicts of law
          principles. Any disputes will be handled in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington, unless
          applicable law requires a different venue.
